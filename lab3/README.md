This lab wasn't too bad. Getting mantis installed was a bit hard. I had to read the
documentation and making sure I had PHP. Apache was good for this. Screenshots show me
adding an issue and it being documented in mantis. I actually do like having my WebSci
information on github. I can switch between working on my Linux Ubuntu and Windows machine.
