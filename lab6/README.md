Lab 6 wasn't too bad. I had trouble deciding what I wanted to do in terms of doing file conversions server side or client side. I ended up going with server side because it is a little bit simpler. There is more funcitonality and options to conver the file format easier. If we were to have the file sent to the client's browser, I would still choose to do this on the backend because that would leave less overhead for the client to deal with.
